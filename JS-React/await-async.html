      //An asynchronous operation is an action that takes time to produce some result. 
      //This could be fetching data over a network for example.

       //What is Promises
        // Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
        // where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code
       

      //The JavaScript runtime environment provides the ability to execute code asynchronously in parallel with other tasks. This allows us to perform multiple operations at the same time without
      /*
      The browser has two threads: the main thread where JavaScript code executes; and the event loop thread where events are processed such as mouse clicks or key p
      Asynchronous operations are handled in JavaScript using callbacks or promises. Callbacks allow you to specify code to run when the results of an asynchronous call have been
      const getUsers = Promise.all([getUser(),getPosts()]);
      */

      ///what is async await
        //async is key word which is used when we have function which take some time to perform
        //u have to used await inside async to handle promises
        //async function always return Promise
        //we want our code to be asynchronous
        //async and await are used to handle Promise
        //explain how function execution suspended till promise resolve and once it resolve it will resume from where it suspended

      //The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function that will return a promise.
      // Inside which we will use await keyword which will asynchronously wait for the complete
      // resolution and rejection of the returned promise.

     

      //HOw fetch works
        //The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request data from a server. fetch retuns a promise
        //fetch returns response ...then we need to convert this resonse body into .json

      

      //sometimes some JS operations will take time to complete task or operations such as network requests and file operations calling 2-4 functions which is depended on each other
      //for that we used callback functionality to handle asynchronous operations and event handling.
      //Because of the callback hell and Inversion of control(IOC) problem, 
      // we use Promises to handle asynchronous tasks in JavaScript and make our application scalable.
      //.then().json.catch().finally()...send in error handling and overall increases the reliability of our code.
      //please read above statement
      //With async and await you can write promises in a much cleaner way.
      //IMP
      //The most important difference between .then and async await is that
      // an async function will pause the function execution until the promise finishes. 
      //When using .then the rest of the function will execute while the promise finishes.

      //Modules in JavaScript: import and export

      //Closure in JavaScript
/* Closure is the feature of JavaScript that allows an inner function to have access to its 
current scope as well as its lexical parent scope. It is a very fundamental, basic yet important concept of JavaScript.
 The closure has the property of encapsulation, code organization, and memorization of its lexical parent scope. 
 In react.js privacy can be achieved using closures, by creating encapsulated logic inside components.

Example:


function start() {
  var content = "GeeksforGeeks"; // content is a local variable created by start()
  function company() {
    // company() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(content); // using variable declared in the parent function
  }
  company();
}
start(); */
