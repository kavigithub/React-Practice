        /* In JavaScript, variables and functions are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
         This means that when the test() function is executed, the x variable inside the function is declared first, but it is not initialized until the var x = 20; line is reached.

        can you explain me this line as var x = 10 has global scope then why can't we access it inside the function? the outer x variable is accessible inside the function, but it is being shadowed by the inner x variable with the same name.

In JavaScript, when a variable with the same name is declared inside a function, it takes precedence over the outer variable with the same name. This is known as variable shadowing. The inner variable effectively hides the outer variable within the scope of the function.

In your example, the outer x variable is declared in the global scope and is initialized to 10. When the test() function is executed, a new x variable is declared in the local scope of the function, initialized to 20. This inner x variable shadows the outer x variable, making it inaccessible within the scope of the function.

To access the outer x variable inside the function, you can either rename the inner x variable or use the window object to access the global x variable: */
        var x = 10;
        function test(){
            console.log(x); //variab
            var x = 20;
        }
        test();
        console.log(x)

        /* var x = 10;
    function test(){
        console.log(window.x);
    }
    test();
    console.log(x) */

/*     Javascript has a function-level-scope. That means blocks such as if-statements and loops do not create new scopes in JavaScript. Rather a new scope is created only when a function is defined. */

var xy = 10;
    console.log(xy);
     
   /*  if (true) {
        var xy = 20;
        console.log(xy); //20
    } 
        console.log(xy); //20
    */

    if (true) {
        (function(){
            var xy = 20;
            console.log(xy);
        })();
    }
     
    console.log(xy);

    var xyz = 100;
    function scopeTest(){
       /*  console.log(xyz); example of variable shadowing
        var xyz = 90; */
        if(xyz > 200){
            var xyz = 50;
        }
        console.log(xyz);
    }
    scopeTest();

    function test2(){
        if(false){
            var cd = 100;
        }

        console.log(cd);
        console.log(mi);

        var mi = 'mumbai indians'
        console.log(mi);
    }

    test2();

    /* const iop;
    console.log(iop); */
